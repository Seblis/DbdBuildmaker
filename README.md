## Virtual environment setup
Right now project is running on Django 4.1.2 with Python 3.10. If you have Python 3.10 installed, you can simply call `python -m venv .venv` in Powershell. After that, activate virtual environment and install Django like that:

```
./.venv/Scripts/Activate.ps1
pip install Django~=4.1.2
```

Later on you will use all Django commands after enabling virtual environment with the scripte Activate.ps1 like the first line above.
